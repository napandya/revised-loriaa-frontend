<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a full-stack CRM application for Property Management based on a series of Figma designs.

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:
1.  **UI Implementation (Phase 1):** Build the frontend UI for all pages based on provided Figma screenshots. This includes:
    *   Dashboard (with a pie chart)
    *   Sidebar (with a specific dark navy color and custom logo)
    *   Leads Page
    *   Inbox/Communication Hub (with specific chat bubble styling)
    *   Communication Analytics
    *   Leasing Agent Page (Kanban view)
    *   Marketing Agent Page (Kanban view)
    *   Property Manager Studio (3 tabs: Knowledge Base, Task Command Center, Next Best Action)
    *   Settings Page
2.  **Backend Migration (Phase 2):** Migrate the backend from its initial state (MongoDB) to a new stack using PostgreSQL and the  extension, keeping all API endpoints the same.
3.  **Frontend-Backend Integration (Phase 3):** Connect all the implemented frontend pages to the live backend API to replace the hardcoded data.
4.  **Testing:** Perform final testing of the frontend and backend repositories.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application with a React/TypeScript frontend and a Python/FastAPI backend. The backend database has been successfully migrated from MongoDB to PostgreSQL with . All frontend pages have been built according to the user's Figma designs and have been wired to the live backend API endpoints, replacing the initial mock data. Authentication is currently mocked.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The agent finished wiring all frontend pages to the backend API and initiated a comprehensive test run using the frontend testing agent to verify the integration. This process was interrupted.

-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1 (P0):** The comprehensive frontend test run was interrupted and needs to be completed.
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent started the test run with  but the session was reset.
    -   **Next debug checklist:** Rerun the frontend testing agent to validate that all pages correctly fetch and display data from the API.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To ensure the frontend-backend integration is stable and all pages are functioning as expected with live data.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N

    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1 (P0):** Complete the comprehensive frontend testing.
    -   **Where to resume:** Re-run the frontend testing agent command: 
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** This will validate the successful integration of the entire frontend with the backend API.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    -   **Blocked on something:** None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    -   (P1) User acceptance testing (UAT) of the fully integrated application.
-   **Future Tasks:**
    -   Implement a full authentication system to replace the current mock auth.
    -   Implement AI-driven features, leveraging the provided OpenAI key and the AI Workforce section.
    -   Implement the actual integrations for ResMan, Facebook Ads, and Twilio SMS as shown on the Settings page.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Frontend UI Implementation:** All pages were created or rebuilt to match Figma designs, including , , , , , , and . The  component was also restyled multiple times to match color and logo specifications.
-   **Backend Migration:** The backend was fully migrated from MongoDB to PostgreSQL. This involved creating new SQLAlchemy models (), setting up a new database connection (), and rewriting the API logic in  to use the new stack.
-   **Frontend-Backend Integration:** All frontend pages were wired to the live backend API, removing all hardcoded data. This involved adding data fetching logic (using ) to every page component.
-   **Testing:**
    -   The initial frontend implementation was tested and passed ().
    -   The backend migration was tested and passed ().

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None. All UI and functional issues raised by the user during the session were addressed.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   **Issue recurrence in previous fork:** None specified in the history.
-   **Recurrence count:** 0
-   **Status:** NA

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Zustand, Recharts.
-   **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy (ORM), PostgreSQL.
-   **Database:** PostgreSQL with the  extension for vector similarity search capabilities.
-   **Architecture:** Monorepo containing separate  and  applications communicating via a REST API.

**key DB schema**
-   **users:** {id, email, name, password_hash, created_at}
-   **team_members:** {id, user_id, role, status, created_at, updated_at}
-   **leads:** {id, name, email, phone, status, source, created_at, updated_at}
-   **conversations:** {id, lead_id, status, created_at, updated_at}
-   **messages:** {id, conversation_id, sender, content, message_type, embedding (Vector), created_at}
-   **documents:** {id, name, content, category, status, embedding (Vector), created_at}

**changes in tech stack**
-   The backend database was migrated from **MongoDB to PostgreSQL**.
-   The  extension was installed and configured in PostgreSQL.
-   The Python data access layer was changed from  to a combination of , , and .

**All files of reference**
-   : Contains all FastAPI API endpoints; rewritten to use SQLAlchemy instead of pymongo.
-   : New file created to handle PostgreSQL database connection with SQLAlchemy.
-   : New file created to define all database tables as SQLAlchemy models.
-   : Defines the application's routes for all pages.
-   : Directory containing all page components, which were updated to fetch data from the live API.
-   : Updated with the  for the PostgreSQL connection.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
None identified as critical. The code appears modular.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The immediate next step is to resume the interrupted frontend test run. The user has confirmed the environment is ready (its recharged continue).
-   The application is fully built according to the provided Figma designs, and all pages are connected to the live backend.
-   Authentication is mocked. Do not attempt to implement a full login flow unless explicitly asked.
-   The backend stack is now PostgreSQL + pgvector. Do not reintroduce or use MongoDB.
